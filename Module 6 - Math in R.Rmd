```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Working with math in R and matrices.

```{r, comment = NA}
A=matrix(c(2,0,1,3), ncol=2)
B=matrix(c(5,2,4,-1), ncol=2)
sumAB = A+B
sumAB
diffAB = A-B
diffAB
```

A+B creates a 2x2 matrix with values `r A+B`, and A-B creates a 2x2 matrix with values `r A-B`

```{r, comment = NA}
diag = diag(c(4,1,2,3), 4, 4)
diag

m = diag(3, 5, 5)
m[1,] = 1
m[,1] = 2
m[1,1] = 3
m
```

Using the 'diag' function, we can first create a matrix with the diagonal values set to 3, and then append the other values accordingly.
